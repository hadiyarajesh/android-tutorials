# Activity Lifecycle Visualizer

This Android app provides a visual preview of the different lifecycle states that an Android app goes through, including `onCreate`, `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop`, `onDestroy`. With this app, you can understand how your app transitions between different states during runtime and optimize its performance accordingly.
